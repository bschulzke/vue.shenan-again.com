            `Welcome to 21st century Earth, otherwise known as the world right outside your window. Everything’s pretty much the same as whenever you last checked. Unemployment keeps going up. Except when it doesn’t. Everyone complains about taxes and gas prices. Your grandpa likes to remind you how much better things were back in his day. You know, back when the US was at war and computers weren’t so complicated.`,
            `… Where were we? Right. Everything’s pretty much the regular old planet Earth you’re used to. But there’s one important thing  you’ve probably never heard of, what with it being top secret and all. A couple years ago, the government discovered a whole bunch of extraterrestrial technology that nobody quite understands. At least, we assume it’s extraterrestrial, unless some country’s been off building some crazy tech and not telling us about it. Which is definitely possible.`,
            `Point is, they found some of this tech, and as shady government organizations are wont to do, they covered it all up and pretended it didn’t exist. They gave it some kind of technical, sciency name, but most people who’re “in the know” just call them Coils. The specialists who’ve been allowed to examine the Coils are pretty sure they can do a lot more than we’ve realized, we just don’t know how to work them. We’re like a bunch of cavemen who’ve discovered an iPhone, and the only part we’ve figured out how to use is the pizza button on the Domino’s app. But we have figured out one thing the Coils do, and it’s a heck of a lot better than one-click pizza, let me tell you.`,
            `You might be wondering how I know all this, given that it’s top-secret, need-to-know kinda info. Great question. Thing is, over the past couple years, a few of those Coils have … gone missing. One of them eventually made its way into my hands, and I’ve been using it in various business dealings ever since. It’s quite handy. What exactly does it do? Well, I’m not the best person to ask, as my grasp on the subject is even more tenuous than that of the experts. Who, to be quite frank, know next to nothing.`,
            `But I’ll give it a go. When we turn the Coil on, it bends the space-time continuum. Creates an anomaly. In plain English, it starts a time loop, like in that movie where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over. Except this Loop only lasts an hour instead of a day, and it only repeats three times. So you get three tries at whatever you want to do during that hour, but the last one’s the one you’re stuck with. I’ve had some of my own genius types take a gander at my Coil, and they agree that there’s a heck of a lot more this thing can do. Given the money we’re already making on this thing, I’d love to find out what else it can do. The boys in the lab warn me that further experimentation could have catastrophic consequences. Potentially apocalyptic-level stuff, apparently. But hey, you can’t expect big rewards if you’re not willing to take big risks.`,
            `Speaking of risks, I’ve got a job that calls for some… particular skills. You in?`

            "Shenan-Again is all about controlled chaos. You and your friends will take on the role of a crew of thieves attempting to pull off a difficult heist using a stolen Coil, a piece of alien technology that warps time. You’ll enjoy thrilling, daring successes, but you’ll also face crushing—yet quite often hilarious—failures. Ultimately, Shenan-Again is a game about taking calculated risks and learning from your mistakes. It's about second (and third) chances.",
            "Because Shenan-Again isn't just a heist story, it's a time-loop heist story. In the game, you'll relive the same heist three times, one hour each time, so you get three chances to get it right. The second and third time around, you’ll already know a lot of what’s going on. The mechanics of the game are designed to reflect the experience gained through each iteration of the loop as you work to perfect your plan."

            "To play, you’ll need 4-6 people: one person will act as Gamemaster (GM) and the rest of the players will be the Crew. The GM acts as a kind of narrator, presenting the situation to the Crew. The Crew takes actions to overcome obstacles and pull off the heist. In this rulebook, we use “the Crew” and “the players” interchangeably—in both cases we mean all the players besides the GM. You’ll also need a table, a notebook, some six-sided dice of at least two different colors (or sizes), and a handful of index cards.",
            "It doesn’t take long to learn the rules of Shenan-Again. This rulebook outlines everything in detail, including tips and examples, but one player who’s read this rulebook (specifically the GM) can easily explain the game to the rest in just a few minutes, and then you can get right into playing",
            "A game of Shenan-Again begins by establishing the scenario. The GM will let you know what you’re stealing, and who from. Then you’ll put together a crew. Once that’s settled, you’ll start a one hour timer. You’ll take turns explaining what you’d like to do and rolling dice to see if you succeed. The GM narrates the results of your success or failure, you decide what to do next, and so on. After one hour, the timer will go off, and the loop will reset. ",
            "Most likely, the first time around will devolve into an absolute mess before the end, despite your best efforts. That’s okay! You’ll learn a lot, and laugh a lot, and you’ll be ready for round two! The second time around, you remember what happened in the first loop, but the people you’re robbing don’t, which gives you an edge.",
            "Even still, unless you’re exceptionally lucky, you probably won’t quite pull off the heist on the second try either. That’s for the third and final loop. First time’s mostly just for figuring out what not to do. Second time’s for figuring out what to do. And the third time’s for getting it right."

Your players may have read through the rulebook, but if you’re the only one who knows the rules, then you’ll have to teach them. Although this rulebook takes its time laying things out clearly, you’ll find that you can explain the basic rules in just a few minutes. You can find details on the rules of gameplay in Shenan-Again in Part 3 — The Play. If you’re teaching the players the rules before playing, don’t read through them all. Use the Quick Start Guide to remind yourself, and just go over things quickly and concisely.`,

            `If your players are familiar with other tabletop roleplaying games, they’ll probably come in with certain assumptions of how things will work, so it’s important to set up the right expectations, especially when it comes to where this game is different. In most tabletop RPGs, you can take as much time as you want discussing options and making plans. But Shenan-Again is meant to be a wild ride with hardly a second to breathe. Make sure your players understand that the timer will not be paused under any circumstances. They will feel like there isn’t enough time—that’s part of the point! The crazy rush to throw together a plan on the fly, coupled with unpredictable failures and sudden detours, give Shenan-Again a feeling of controlled chaos from the moment the timer starts.`

You explain the scenario, describe the outcomes of rolls, and play the other characters the Crew encounters. To do all this, you’ll need a scenario. A scenario is basically like the roadmap for your story. It doesn't tell you where the Crew will go or what they will do, but it gives you an idea of some places they could go and some things they might do. Most importantly, it outlines what obstacles will get in their way. `,

        title: 'Pacing the Time Loops',
        paragraphs: [
            `In a game of Shenan-Again, the Crew uses a Coil, a piece of mysterious extraterrestrial technology that can bend the space-time continuum, to pull off a challenging heist.`,
            `The Coil creates a time loop. If you’ve seen Groundhog Day, you’ve already got a pretty good grasp on how this works. The difference here is instead of living the same day over and over, you repeat just one hour, and you only live through that hour three times in total. The last time is the final loop, the one that “sticks.”`,
            `Once the Coil is activated, there’s exactly one hour until the loop resets. As soon as that hour is up, the Crew finds themselves back where they began, in time and space. No one else will have any memory of what happened.`,
            `That’s when the second loop begins. Again at the end of the second loop, everything resets to the exact moment when the Coil was activated, and the hour begins again. The third loop is different, however, because instead of resetting after one hour, time continues to flow normally. The third loop is the final loop, so that’s when players need to make sure to pull off the heist. Doesn’t matter if they pull it off the first time or the second time, everything will reset and they’ll have to do it all over again. Players have to get it right on the third loop.`,
            `The first loop will mostly be a learning experience. During the second loop, players will start to solidify their plan. It's in the third and final loop that everything will (hopefully) come together. At the beginning of the third loop, you'll still set a timer for one hour, but this time, when that third timer goes off, the loop doesn't reset. Instead, if the Crew hasn't successfully pulled off the heist before that third timer goes off, they get caught.`,
            `Each one-hour loop should build on the last one. Although they’re living the same hour each time, for the most part things should happen differently each time. This will naturally happen due to random rolls of the dice, changes the Crew makes to their plan, and the advantage they earn through practice. However, it also falls on you as GM to make sure that players encounter new obstacles each loop. For this reason, be sure to have more obstacles prepared than they can possibly get through in the first or second loops. We’ve found that 12–16 total obstacles is a good target number for a scenario.`,
            `Although the loops should build, it’s also critical you don’t break the sense that it really is a time loop. Things the Crew hasn’t interacted with shouldn’t change from one loop to the next. If a guard makes a certain round during the first loop, she should make the same round during the second loop—unless, of course, the players have done something that could plausibly interfere with this. This is how you balance the need for change with the need for continuity. Even just slightly different timing on the part of the players can be an excuse for you to mix things up. In addition, whenever the players fail a roll, they’ll fail in a different way than they did before, which can create a new chain of events.`,
            `Try to limit the number of new obstacles introduced in the final loop to just a couple, mainly one or two complications for getting out. If everything seems to be going fairly smoothly in the final loop, perhaps the cops show up right as they’re escaping, and you could end the game with an epic car chase.`,
            `Since they get three loops, players shouldn’t be too worried about messing things up. Let them try things out, learn and gain experience, and enjoy the ride!`

        paragraphs: [
            `Both as you’re planning and as you’re running the game, remember that your job is not to come up with a story. Let your players surprise you! A game of Shenan-Again is always full of twists and turns that no one at the table could’ve predicted, and that includes you as the GM. A story is the result of characters pursuing a goal and running into obstacles which impede them in that pursuit. This creates conflict, which is resolved by the choices the characters make.`,
            `As GM, you’ll give the players their goal and present obstacles, but they’re in charge of choosing how to deal with the obstacles in front of them. That’s what creates the story—their choices. So when you’re thinking about obstacles, avoid the temptation to think of solutions. Both you and the players will have much more fun if you discover the story together, rather than trying to force the players along on a story you came up with. Everyone will have more fun if the players have to rely on each other, rather than you.`,
            `Each player should also have a chance to be in the spotlight. In general, we’d suggest you avoid outlining specific solutions to obstacles for your players, but if you notice a player hasn’t rolled dice recently or seems less engaged, suggest to the group ways that this player could help solve a particular problem. Make sure everyone gets to participate!`,

        title: "Challenges",
        paragraphs: [
            `In order to overcome obstacles, your players will make Challenge rolls. As your players move through the game, a good rule of thumb is to make sure that they are rolling Challenges every three to five minutes. The timer itself should motivate the players to keep moving things along, but if things start to drag, throw in a new obstacle or complication to keep up the pacing. Basically, if you’re not sure whether you should call for a roll on a certain action, you should probably call for a roll. It’s more fun! Even if there doesn’t seem to be much chance of “failure” with a particular action, there’s always a way it could go wrong.`,
            `Now, obviously don’t call for a roll to open unlocked doors or walk down unguarded hallways. But also, if you have too many unlocked doors and unguarded hallways, you’re probably doing something wrong. A game of Shenan-Again should be challenging and constantly subvert the player’s expectations.
            Your goal as GM is for the players to win, but you don’t want to make it easy for them. A perfect game of Shenan-Again will be up in the air until the last minute or two, or even the last thirty seconds. To create that tension, there needs to be a real fear of failure, so if you’re in that third loop and the players are clipping along a little too fast, throw a wrench in their plans by introducing a new complication.`

    {
        title: "Failure",
        paragraphs: [
            `In a good game of Shenan-Again, players never know what might happen when they attempt their rolls. This uncertainty is part of the magic and adventure of the game. A great way to ensure that your players feel that magic and to keep them on the edge of their seats is keeping the complications of failure interesting.`,
            `Think about a story you enjoy, whether that’s a TV show, book, or movie. When the the protagonist tries something and fails, does it ever just “not work”? Chances are, failure adds some kind of complication which makes the story more interesting and drives it forward. That’s how a complication for a failed roll in Shenan-Again should feel.`,
            `The results of failure should always be unpredictable. You can’t plan how you’re going to fail, right? If you succeed, that usually means things go about how you planned, but if you fail, that means things play out in a way you couldn’t have anticipated. This forces you to adapt and keeps you on your toes.`,
            `Make sure that your complication always requires the players to take a new approach, rather than just rolling for the same thing again. To help you think of different types of complications, we’ve broken them down into three types, but there are infinite different ways things could go wrong. These are just a few ideas:`,
            `“Yes but…” — The player who was rolling technically succeeds, but something they hadn’t intended also happens. This still counts as a failure when it comes to calculating advantage, and complications from this are treated just like any other failure.`,
            `“Instead” — The player meant to do one thing, but instead, they end up doing something very different.`,
            `“Seems like it worked.” — This can be fun, but use it sparingly. In these cases, the player knows they failed the roll, but you just smile and tell them that it seems like it worked. In your head, you’ve thought of something that went wrong, but you don’t tell the players yet. Instead, just leave them guessing about what might have happened, and keep that reveal for a bit later down the road.`,
            `Avoid having the complication from a failed roll be “You get caught/captured.” That’s kinda boring, unless it moves the story forward somehow. Just having them locked up in an empty room isn’t interesting, but if that locked room is also occupied by some poor minion who’s displeased the boss, or it has a broken floorboard that leads down into the basement—now that’s interesting.`,
