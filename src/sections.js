            `Welcome to 21st century Earth, otherwise known as the world right outside your window. Everything’s pretty much the same as whenever you last checked. Unemployment keeps going up. Except when it doesn’t. Everyone complains about taxes and gas prices. Your grandpa likes to remind you how much better things were back in his day. You know, back when the US was at war and computers weren’t so complicated.`,
            `… Where were we? Right. Everything’s pretty much the regular old planet Earth you’re used to. But there’s one important thing  you’ve probably never heard of, what with it being top secret and all. A couple years ago, the government discovered a whole bunch of extraterrestrial technology that nobody quite understands. At least, we assume it’s extraterrestrial, unless some country’s been off building some crazy tech and not telling us about it. Which is definitely possible.`,
            `Point is, they found some of this tech, and as shady government organizations are wont to do, they covered it all up and pretended it didn’t exist. They gave it some kind of technical, sciency name, but most people who’re “in the know” just call them Coils. The specialists who’ve been allowed to examine the Coils are pretty sure they can do a lot more than we’ve realized, we just don’t know how to work them. We’re like a bunch of cavemen who’ve discovered an iPhone, and the only part we’ve figured out how to use is the pizza button on the Domino’s app. But we have figured out one thing the Coils do, and it’s a heck of a lot better than one-click pizza, let me tell you.`,
            `You might be wondering how I know all this, given that it’s top-secret, need-to-know kinda info. Great question. Thing is, over the past couple years, a few of those Coils have … gone missing. One of them eventually made its way into my hands, and I’ve been using it in various business dealings ever since. It’s quite handy. What exactly does it do? Well, I’m not the best person to ask, as my grasp on the subject is even more tenuous than that of the experts. Who, to be quite frank, know next to nothing.`,
            `But I’ll give it a go. When we turn the Coil on, it bends the space-time continuum. Creates an anomaly. In plain English, it starts a time loop, like in that movie where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over. Except this Loop only lasts an hour instead of a day, and it only repeats three times. So you get three tries at whatever you want to do during that hour, but the last one’s the one you’re stuck with. I’ve had some of my own genius types take a gander at my Coil, and they agree that there’s a heck of a lot more this thing can do. Given the money we’re already making on this thing, I’d love to find out what else it can do. The boys in the lab warn me that further experimentation could have catastrophic consequences. Potentially apocalyptic-level stuff, apparently. But hey, you can’t expect big rewards if you’re not willing to take big risks.`,

Make it specific enough that you’ll recall the context, so for the Burglar’s roll to sneak past the security camera at the gate, rather than writing just “sneak”, perhaps jot down, “sneak—gate camera.” Including timestamps in your challenge notes can help in keeping track of this.

        paragraphs: [
            `In a game of Shenan-Again, the Crew uses a Coil, a piece of mysterious extraterrestrial technology that can bend the space-time continuum, to pull off a challenging heist.`,
            `The Coil creates a time loop. If you’ve seen Groundhog Day, you’ve already got a pretty good grasp on how this works. The difference here is instead of living the same day over and over, you repeat just one hour, and you only live through that hour three times in total. The last time is the final loop, the one that “sticks.”`,
            `Once the Coil is activated, there’s exactly one hour until the loop resets. As soon as that hour is up, the Crew finds themselves back where they began, in time and space. No one else will have any memory of what happened.`,
            `That’s when the second loop begins. Again at the end of the second loop, everything resets to the exact moment when the Coil was activated, and the hour begins again. The third loop is different, however, because instead of resetting after one hour, time continues to flow normally. The third loop is the final loop, so that’s when players need to make sure to pull off the heist. Doesn’t matter if they pull it off the first time or the second time, everything will reset and they’ll have to do it all over again. Players have to get it right on the third loop.`,
            `The first loop will mostly be a learning experience. During the second loop, players will start to solidify their plan. It's in the third and final loop that everything will (hopefully) come together. At the beginning of the third loop, you'll still set a timer for one hour, but this time, when that third timer goes off, the loop doesn't reset. Instead, if the Crew hasn't successfully pulled off the heist before that third timer goes off, they get caught.`,
            `Each one-hour loop should build on the last one. Although they’re living the same hour each time, for the most part things should happen differently each time. This will naturally happen due to random rolls of the dice, changes the Crew makes to their plan, and the advantage they earn through practice. However, it also falls on you as GM to make sure that players encounter new obstacles each loop. For this reason, be sure to have more obstacles prepared than they can possibly get through in the first or second loops. We’ve found that 12–16 total obstacles is a good target number for a scenario.`,
            `Although the loops should build, it’s also critical you don’t break the sense that it really is a time loop. Things the Crew hasn’t interacted with shouldn’t change from one loop to the next. If a guard makes a certain round during the first loop, she should make the same round during the second loop—unless, of course, the players have done something that could plausibly interfere with this. This is how you balance the need for change with the need for continuity. Even just slightly different timing on the part of the players can be an excuse for you to mix things up. In addition, whenever the players fail a roll, they’ll fail in a different way than they did before, which can create a new chain of events.`,
            `Try to limit the number of new obstacles introduced in the final loop to just a couple, mainly one or two complications for getting out. If everything seems to be going fairly smoothly in the final loop, perhaps the cops show up right as they’re escaping, and you could end the game with an epic car chase.`,
            `Since they get three loops, players shouldn’t be too worried about messing things up. Let them try things out, learn and gain experience, and enjoy the ride!`

The timer itself should motivate the players to keep moving things along, but if things start to drag, throw in a new obstacle or complication to keep up the pacing. Basically, if you’re not sure whether you should call for a roll on a certain action, you should probably call for a roll. It’s more fun! Even if there doesn’t seem to be much chance of “failure” with a particular action, there’s always a way it could go wrong.`,

                    `“Yes but…” — The player who was rolling technically succeeds, but something they hadn’t intended also happens. This still counts as a failure when it comes to calculating advantage, and complications from this are treated just like any other failure.`,

In these cases, the player knows they failed the roll, but you just smile and tell them that it seems like it worked. In your head, you’ve thought of something that went wrong, but you don’t tell the players yet. Instead, just leave them guessing about what might have happened, and keep that reveal for a bit later down the road.`,

In the second and third loops they’ll refine and perfect that plan based on their experience. The leader takes charge during planning—they’ll mediate between players with differing approaches and decide on the best course of action for the Crew. Don’t take too much time on this step—it’s much better spent just going for it. While it’s not entirely realistic, it’s way more fun if the Crew just kinda wings it. Doing <b>something</b> is always more fun than sitting around deliberating. The Crew will want to take a moment at the beginning of each new loop to reassess the plan—but again—don’t let it eat up too much time. Remember, you’re on the clock! `

                    `There’s no set turn order in Shenan-Again. Instead, it’s up to the Crew to switch from one crewmember to another depending on what needs to happen next. In-world, your characters are all equipped with earpieces, so you can  communicate with one another in real time. You can use this fact to make suggestions about who should go next and how you  deal with obstacles that arise. Bring those suggestions to your crew’s leader (not the Gamemaster) because the leader calls the shots,they decide who goes when. The leader should make decisions quickly, as deliberating too long will eat up precious time.`,
                    `If you’re the leader, wherever possible, try to spread tasks out evenly between the players so that everyone can contribute and have a good time. Even if you’re not the leader, you can help out by noticing if one player’s being left out—suggest ways to put their skills to use. It can be helpful at times to have players pair up and work together, especially if you have a larger group. These pairs are fluid from one minute to the next, subject to adaptation based on the needs of the heist.`,
                    `A lot of situations rely on a sequence of events. First the Conman distracts a guard, then the Burglar sneaks past. But sometimes you’ll want two players to do something “at the same time.” In this case, you still choose one player to roll first, but rather than resolving any of their recovery rolls if they fail, (see Failing a Roll), immediately switch to the other player. Once they’ve both made their first roll, you can keep resolving their failures and/or let other players take turns based on the situation.`,

To reflect these difficult tasks, where there’s a real chance of failure and where failure would throw a complication in the Crew’s plan, the GM will call for the player to perform a Challenge roll, which determines if they succeed or fail.

Whenever players are called upon to roll for a Challenge, they can roll as many Luck Dice as they wish to overcome that Challenge. As long as they roll a six on at least one die, they succeed. This doesn’t mean adding up the results. Look to see if <b>at least one die comes up as a six</b>. If they don't roll a single six, they fail.

In this case, they must roll at least one six on any one of the dice, regardless of which type of die it is. If they wish, they can just roll your two Skill Dice with no Luck Dice, though the odds of rolling a six on just the Skill Dice are fairly slim. If the Challenge doesn’t relate to their Role, but they don’t want to waste any Luck Dice on it, they can always roll just one Skill Dice alone.

As they begin to make choices, give them obstacles as needed to build the tension and keep things interesting.`,
