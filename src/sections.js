            `Welcome to 21st century Earth, otherwise known as the world right outside your window. Everything’s pretty much the same as whenever you last checked. Unemployment keeps going up. Except when it doesn’t. Everyone complains about taxes and gas prices. Your grandpa likes to remind you how much better things were back in his day. You know, back when the US was at war and computers weren’t so complicated.`,
            `… Where were we? Right. Everything’s pretty much the regular old planet Earth you’re used to. But there’s one important thing  you’ve probably never heard of, what with it being top secret and all. A couple years ago, the government discovered a whole bunch of extraterrestrial technology that nobody quite understands. At least, we assume it’s extraterrestrial, unless some country’s been off building some crazy tech and not telling us about it. Which is definitely possible.`,
            `Point is, they found some of this tech, and as shady government organizations are wont to do, they covered it all up and pretended it didn’t exist. They gave it some kind of technical, sciency name, but most people who’re “in the know” just call them Coils. The specialists who’ve been allowed to examine the Coils are pretty sure they can do a lot more than we’ve realized, we just don’t know how to work them. We’re like a bunch of cavemen who’ve discovered an iPhone, and the only part we’ve figured out how to use is the pizza button on the Domino’s app. But we have figured out one thing the Coils do, and it’s a heck of a lot better than one-click pizza, let me tell you.`,
            `You might be wondering how I know all this, given that it’s top-secret, need-to-know kinda info. Great question. Thing is, over the past couple years, a few of those Coils have … gone missing. One of them eventually made its way into my hands, and I’ve been using it in various business dealings ever since. It’s quite handy. What exactly does it do? Well, I’m not the best person to ask, as my grasp on the subject is even more tenuous than that of the experts. Who, to be quite frank, know next to nothing.`,
            `But I’ll give it a go. When we turn the Coil on, it bends the space-time continuum. Creates an anomaly. In plain English, it starts a time loop, like in that movie where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over. Except this Loop only lasts an hour instead of a day, and it only repeats three times. So you get three tries at whatever you want to do during that hour, but the last one’s the one you’re stuck with. I’ve had some of my own genius types take a gander at my Coil, and they agree that there’s a heck of a lot more this thing can do. Given the money we’re already making on this thing, I’d love to find out what else it can do. The boys in the lab warn me that further experimentation could have catastrophic consequences. Potentially apocalyptic-level stuff, apparently. But hey, you can’t expect big rewards if you’re not willing to take big risks.`,
            `Speaking of risks, I’ve got a job that calls for some… particular skills. You in?`

            "Shenan-Again is all about controlled chaos. You and your friends will take on the role of a crew of thieves attempting to pull off a difficult heist using a stolen Coil, a piece of alien technology that warps time. You’ll enjoy thrilling, daring successes, but you’ll also face crushing—yet quite often hilarious—failures. Ultimately, Shenan-Again is a game about taking calculated risks and learning from your mistakes. It's about second (and third) chances.",
            "Because Shenan-Again isn't just a heist story, it's a time-loop heist story. In the game, you'll relive the same heist three times, one hour each time, so you get three chances to get it right. The second and third time around, you’ll already know a lot of what’s going on. The mechanics of the game are designed to reflect the experience gained through each iteration of the loop as you work to perfect your plan."

            "This rulebook assumes that you don’t have the Shenan-Again game box, so explanations about tracking the pool of Luck Dice and writing the Crew’s character concepts are slightly different here, but the essential elements of the game remain the same."

        title: "The Game",
        paragraphs: [
            "To play, you’ll need 4-6 people: one person will act as Gamemaster (GM) and the rest of the players will be the Crew. The GM acts as a kind of narrator, presenting the situation to the Crew. The Crew takes actions to overcome obstacles and pull off the heist. In this rulebook, we use “the Crew” and “the players” interchangeably—in both cases we mean all the players besides the GM. You’ll also need a table, a notebook, some six-sided dice of at least two different colors (or sizes), and a handful of index cards.",
            "It doesn’t take long to learn the rules of Shenan-Again. This rulebook outlines everything in detail, including tips and examples, but one player who’s read this rulebook (specifically the GM) can easily explain the game to the rest in just a few minutes, and then you can get right into playing",
            "A game of Shenan-Again begins by establishing the scenario. The GM will let you know what you’re stealing, and who from. Then you’ll put together a crew. Once that’s settled, you’ll start a one hour timer. You’ll take turns explaining what you’d like to do and rolling dice to see if you succeed. The GM narrates the results of your success or failure, you decide what to do next, and so on. After one hour, the timer will go off, and the loop will reset. ",
            "Most likely, the first time around will devolve into an absolute mess before the end, despite your best efforts. That’s okay! You’ll learn a lot, and laugh a lot, and you’ll be ready for round two! The second time around, you remember what happened in the first loop, but the people you’re robbing don’t, which gives you an edge.",
            "Even still, unless you’re exceptionally lucky, you probably won’t quite pull off the heist on the second try either. That’s for the third and final loop. First time’s mostly just for figuring out what not to do. Second time’s for figuring out what to do. And the third time’s for getting it right."
